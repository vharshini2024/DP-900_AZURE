# Analytical Data Processing

## Overview
Analytical data processing handles large volumes of historical data for in-depth analysis and reporting. It differs from transactional systems that focus on real-time operations.

## Key Components

### Data Storage
- **Data Lake**: Stores large amounts of raw data.
- **Data Warehouse**: Organizes data into tables for easy querying and reporting.
- **Data Lakehouse**: Combines features of data lakes and warehouses for better scalability and querying.

### Data Aggregation
- **OLAP Model**: Prepares data to be analyzed at different levels (e.g., total sales by region, city, or store).

### Query and Reporting
- Data is used to create reports and dashboards for insights.

## Who Uses It
- **Data Scientists**: Explore raw data in data lakes.
- **Data Analysts**: Create reports from data warehouses.
- **Business Users**: View pre-made summaries in dashboards.
