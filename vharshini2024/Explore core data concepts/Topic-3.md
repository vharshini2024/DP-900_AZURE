# Transactional Data Processing (OLTP)

**Overview:**
Transactional data processing systems manage and record events that organizations need to track, such as financial transactions or retail purchases. These systems handle high volumes of transactions daily, ensuring fast access and reliable data integrity.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Online Transactional Processing (OLTP)**: Focuses on real-time data processing where data is created, retrieved, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations). 

- **ACID Properties**:
  - **Atomicity**: Ensures that each transaction is completed fully or not at all. For example, transferring funds between accounts must either complete both debit and credit actions or fail completely.
  - **Consistency**: Transactions move data from one valid state to another, ensuring data integrity. For example, after a transfer, account balances should reflect the new values.
  - **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, maintaining consistent results. For instance, a balance-checking transaction should not show inconsistent results during an ongoing transfer.
  - **Durability**: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure. For example, after a successful transfer, updated balances will persist after a system restart.

**Use Cases**
OLTP systems are commonly used in line-of-business (LOB) applications that require reliable, real-time data processing.
