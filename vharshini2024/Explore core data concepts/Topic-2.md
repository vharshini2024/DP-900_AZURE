# File Formats
Files can be stored locally on personal hard drives or removable media like USB drives. However, in most organizations, important data files are centrally stored in shared file storage systems. Increasingly, this central storage is hosted in the cloud, providing cost-effective, secure, and reliable storage for large volumes of data.

### Database Types Overview

**Relational Databases**
- **Structure**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- **Query Language**: SQL.
- **Features**: Uses primary keys to link data across tables; supports data normalization to minimize redundancy.

**Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**
- **Key-Value Databases**: Stores data as unique keys with associated values. Flexible and simple.
- **Document Databases**: Stores data as JSON documents. Optimized for complex document querying.
- **Column Family Databases**: Stores data in columns grouped into families. Efficient for large-scale tabular data.
- **Graph Databases**: Stores data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). Ideal for managing and querying complex relationships.

Each database type serves specific needs based on data structure and access patterns.
