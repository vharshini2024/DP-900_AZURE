# File Formats
Files can be stored locally on personal hard drives or removable media like USB drives. However, in most organizations, important data files are centrally stored in shared file storage systems. Increasingly, this central storage is hosted in the cloud, providing cost-effective, secure, and reliable storage for large volumes of data.

The file formats for different types of data well:

## Structured Data:
CSV: Simple and easy to work with for tabular data, but lacks metadata support.

JSON: Useful for data that has a clear hierarchy but still needs a simple structure.

SQL Databases: Store structured data in tables with defined schemas, offering powerful querying capabilities.

## Semi-Structured Data:

JSON: Ideal for hierarchical data with nested structures, commonly used in web APIs and configurations.
XML: Used for data with complex hierarchies and metadata, though it can be more verbose.
YAML: Human-readable and often used for configuration files, offering a more intuitive format than XML.

## Unstructured Data:
Plain Text: Suitable for free-form text, such as logs or documents.
PDF: Common for documents where the layout and appearance are important.
Binary Files: Used for data not meant to be directly read by humans, such as images, executables, or proprietary formats.
